Efficient **logistics and intermediary services** are essential for

# Overview

Logistics and intermediary services bridge the gap between raw material 
producers, manufacturing industries, and final customers. In sectors such 
as precious metals and industrial products, **traceability, compliance, 
and timing** are critical to maintaining trust and meeting market demands.

## Key Challenges

1. **Complex Regulations**  
   Transporting and trading materials—especially precious metals—requires 
   strict adherence to national and international regulations.

2. **Security Risks**  
   High-value goods require secure handling and transport solutions.

3. **Coordination Across Stakeholders**  
   Multiple actors, including miners, processors, traders, and 
   authorities, must work in sync for operations to run smoothly.
